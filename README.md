# tanksonic
This project consist to have an arduino to measure two oil tanks. I took the base from asksin++ project and adapt to my needs.

The adaptation consist to use US-100 ultra-sonic sensor using serial interface instead of using pulseIn method. For me the adantage is the distance measure given is temperature compensed. Moreover there is a possibility to report the tank temperature too. 

Initially I plan to use it for my oil tanks, but I plan also to use it for my water tank located at around 180m from my house.
